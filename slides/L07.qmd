## Introduction: Two-Way ANOVA

- Recall that ANOVA allows us to compare the means of three or more groups.

- In one-way ANOVA, we are only considering one factor (grouping variable). 

- Now, we will discuss two-way ANOVA, which allows us to consider a second factor (grouping variable). 

- We now partition the SS$_{\text{Trt}}$ into the different factors under consideration.
    
- Recall that $\text{SS}_{\text{E}}$ is the "catch all" for unexplained variance. -- when we add factors to our model, we are moving part of the $\text{SS}_{\text{E}}$ into the $\text{SS}_{\text{Trt}}$
    
## Introduction: Two-Way ANOVA

- Let's discuss some of the language used in two-way ANOVA. 

- Factor A has $a$ levels.
    
    - Smoking status: non-smoker and smoker

- Factor B has $b$ levels.

    - Hypertension: normotensive and hypertensive

- There are $ab$ treatment groups.

    - Non-smoker, normotensive
    - Non-smoker, hypertensive
    - Smoker, normotensive
    - Smoker, hypertensive

## Introduction: Two-Way ANOVA

- Now that we are including two factors, we must consider the interaction between the two. 

    - *Interaction*: The relationship between [outcome] and [factor 1] depends on the level of [factor 2].

- In our example, suppose we are looking at weight as the outcome. If an interaction is detected,

    - the relationship between weight and hypertension status depends on smoking status, OR
    - the relationship between weight and smoking status depends on hypertension status. 

## Introduction: Two-Way ANOVA

- The ANOVA table that we are working to construct: 

| **Source** | **Sum of Squares** | **df** | **Mean Square** | ***F*** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
A | SS<sub>A</sub> | df<sub>A</sub> | MS<sub>A</sub> | *F*<sub>A</sub>
B | SS<sub>B</sub> | df<sub>B</sub> | MS<sub>B</sub> | *F*<sub>B</sub>
AB | SS<sub>AB</sub> | df<sub>AB</sub> | MS<sub>AB</sub> | *F*<sub>AB</sub>
Error | SS<sub>E</sub> | df<sub>E</sub> | MS<sub>E</sub> |
Total | SS<sub>Tot</sub> | df<sub>Tot</sub> | | |   

## Computation

- Let there be $a$ levels of factor A and $b$ levels of factor B. 

    - $y_{ijk}$ is the observation on the $k^{th}$ experimental unit receiving the $i^{th}$ level of factor A and the $j^{th}$ level of factor B 
    - $y_{i.}$ is the sum for all observations at the $i^{th}$ level of factor A,
    - $y_{.j}$ is the sum for all observations at the $j^{th}$ level of factor B,
    - $y_{ij}$ is the sum for observations at the $i^{th}$ level of factor A and the $j^{th}$ level of factor B,
    - $y_{..}$ is the sum of all observations, 
    - $(y^2)_{..}$ is the sum of the squared observations, 
    - $n$ is the number in each group (of $a \times b$ treatments)

## Computation

- To find the SS and df:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{SS}_{\text{A}} &= \frac{\sum_i y_{i.}^2}{bn}  - \frac{(y_{..})^2}{abn} & \text{df}_{\text{A}} &= a-1 \\
\text{SS}_{\text{B}} &= \frac{\sum_j y_{.j}^2}{an} - \frac{(y_{..})^2}{abn} & \text{df}_{\text{B}} &= b-1 \\
\text{SS}_{\text{AB}}&= \frac{\sum_{ij} y_{ij}^2}{n} - \frac{(y_{..})^2}{abn} - \text{SS}_{\text{A}} - \text{SS}_{\text{B}} & \text{df}_{\text{AB}} &= (a-1)(b-1) \\
\text{SS}_{\text{E}} &= \text{SS}_{\text{Tot}} - \text{SS}_{\text{A}} - \text{SS}_{\text{B}} - \text{SS}_{\text{AB}} & \text{df}_{\text{E}} &= ab(n-1)  \\
\text{SS}_{\text{Tot}} &= (y^2)_{..} - \frac{(y_{..})^2}{abn} & \text{df}_{\text{Tot}} &= abn-1
\end{align*}  
$$  

- To find the MS and F:
$$\text{MS}_{\text{X}} = \frac{\text{SS}_{\text{X}}}{\text{df}_{\text{X}}} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \text{F}_{\text{X}} = \frac{\text{MS}_{\text{X}}}{\text{MS}_{\text{E}}}$$

## R Syntax

- We will again use `lm()` and `anova()` OR `aov()` and `summary()` to analyze the data.

- As we are specifying our model, we will:
    - include additional terms with +
    - include interaction terms with :
    
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
m <- lm([outcome] ~ [factor A] + [factor B] + [factor A]:[factor B],
        data = [dataset])
anova(m)
```

OR

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
m <- aov([outcome] ~ [factor A] + [factor B] + [factor A]:[factor B],
         data = [dataset])
summary(m)
```

## Example

- Suppose we want to examine the effect of diet and age of mothers on the average birth weight (in ounces). Consider the following data,

<center><img src="images/L12a.png"></center>

- What is the outcome? 
- What are the two factors? 
- What is the interaction term?

## Example

- Suppose we want to examine the effect of diet and age of mothers on the average birth weight (in ounces). Consider the following data,

<center><img src="images/L12a.png"></center>

- What is the outcome? <font color="#db0b9d">birth weight</font>
- What are the two factors? <font color="#db0b9d">diet and age</font>
- What is the interaction term? <font color="#db0b9d">diet $\times$ age</font>

## Example

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

birthweight <- c(157.78, 136.79, 138.84, # age 20-29, diet 1
                 139.72, 125.47, 117.14, # age 20-29, diet 2
                 129.35, 110.73, 118.38, # age 20-29, diet 3
                 137.07, 146.28, 130.27, # age 30-39, diet 1
                 117.46, 128.54, 99.16, # age 30-39, diet 2
                 97.43, 125.26, 115.42) # age 30-39, diet 3
diet <- as.factor(c(1, 1, 1, 
                    2, 2, 2, 
                    3, 3, 3, 
                    1, 1, 1, 
                    2, 2, 2, 
                    3, 3, 3))
age <- as.factor(c(20, 20, 20, 
                   20, 20, 20, 
                   20, 20, 20, 
                   30, 30, 30, 
                   30, 30, 30, 
                   30, 30, 30))
data <- tibble(birthweight, diet, age)
```

## Example

- Let's find the ANOVA table,

```{r}
m <- aov(birthweight ~ diet + age + diet:age, data = data)
summary(m)
```

## Testing Interactions

- **Hypotheses**

    - $H_0:$ there is not an interaction between [factor A] and [factor B]
    - $H_1:$ there is an interaction between [factor A] and [factor B]

- **Test Statistic**

    - $F_{\text{AB}}$ (pull from ANOVA table)

- ***p*-Value**

    - $p = P[F_{\text{df}_{\text{AB}}, \text{df}_{\text{E}}} \ge F_{\text{AB}}]$

- **Rejection Region**

    - Reject $H_0$ if $p<\alpha$.
    
## Example

- Let's now test the interaction between age and diet. Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level.

- Here's the information we need:

```{r}
summary(m)
```

## Example

- **Hypotheses**

    - $H_0:$ there is not an interaction between age and diet
    - $H_1:$ there is an interaction between age and diet

- **Test Statistic**

    - $F_{\text{AB}} = 0.117$
    - $p = 0.891$

- **Rejection Region**

    - Reject $H_0$ if $p<\alpha$; $\alpha=0.05$.
    
- **Conclusion/Interpretation**

    - Fail to reject $H_0$. 
    - There is not sufficient evidence to suggest that the relationship between average birth weight and age depends on the mother's diet. 

## Testing Interactions

- What happens after testing for an interaction? 

    - If significant (reject $H_0$), we can:
    
        - Construct a profile plot to visualize what's going on and help explain the effect. 
        - Examine posthoc testing to further examine the interaction.
    
    - If not significant (FTR $H_0$), we should remove the interaction term so that we can test and interpret the main effects.

- Remember that we cannot look at main effects (A and B alone) when the interaction is included in the model!

## Removing Interactions

- If the interaction term is not significant, it should be removed from the ANOVA table so that we can test and interpret the main effects. 

- How to remove an interaction:

    1. Rewrite ANOVA table without interaction; do not change SS, df, and MS for the main effects and total.
    2. Update the error term: add the SS$_{\text{AB}}$ to SS$_{\text{E}}$ and df$_{\text{AB}}$ to df$_{\text{E}}$.
    3. Recalculate MS$_{\text{E}}$.
    4. Recalculate $F$ statistics for the main effects and perform appropriate hypothesis tests.
    
- In R, we just literally remove the interaction term.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
m <- aov([outcome] ~ [factor A] + [factor B],
         data = [dataset])
summary(m)
```

## Example

- Let's now remove the interaction between diet and maternal age.

```{r}
#m <- aov(birthweight ~ diet + age + diet:age, data = data)
m <- aov(birthweight ~ diet + age, data = data)
summary(m)
```

## Testing Main Effects

- Now that we have removed the interaction term, we can test for main effects. 

- **Hypotheses**

    - $H_0:$ there is not a main effect of [factor X]
    - $H_1:$ there not a main effect of [factor X]

- **Test Statistic**

    - $F_{\text{X}}$ (pull from ANOVA table)

- ***p*-Value**

    - $p = P[F_{\text{df}_{\text{X}}, \text{df}_{\text{E}}} \ge F_{\text{X}}]$

- **Rejection Region**

    - Reject $H_0$ if $p<\alpha$.


## Testing Main Effects

- A note on hypotheses -- we are writing them in sentence form here, however, we can write them mathematically.

- For Factor A with $a$ levels,

    - $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_a$ 
    - $H_1:$ at least one is different

- For Factor B with $b$ levels,

    - $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_b$ 
    - $H_1:$ at least one is different

## Example

- We now want to determine if there are main effects of age and diet. Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level.

- The ANOVA table without the interaction term:

```{r}
summary(m)
```

## Example

- **Hypotheses**

    - $H_0:$ there is not a main effect of diet ($\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3$)
    - $H_1:$ there not a main effect of diet (at least one $\mu_i$ is different)

- **Test Statistic and *p*-Value**

    - $F_{\text{diet}} = 8.646$ 
    - $p = 0.004$

- **Rejection Region**

    - Reject $H_0$ if $p<\alpha$; $\alpha=0.05$.

- **Conclusion/Interpretation**
    
    - Reject $H_0$.
    
    - There is sufficient evidence to suggest that at least one diet reults in a different birth weight.
    
## Example

- **Hypotheses**

    - $H_0:$ there is not a main effect of age ($\mu_1 = \mu_2$)
    - $H_1:$ there not a main effect of age ($\mu_1 \ne \mu_2$)

- **Test Statistic and *p*-Value**

    - $F_{\text{diet}} = 2.728$ 
    - $p = 0.121$

- **Rejection Region**

    - Reject $H_0$ if $p<\alpha$; $\alpha=0.05$.

- **Conclusion/Interpretation**
    
    - Fail to reject $H_0$.
    
    - There is not sufficient evidence to suggest that there is a difference in birth weights across the age groups.

## Introduction: Beyond the *F* Test 

- In this lecture, we are discussing two-way ANOVA.

- So far, we have learned how to:

    - Create an ANOVA model with an interaction term
    - Test the interaction term
    - Create an ANOVA model without an interaction term
    - Test the main effects
    
- Now we will learn how to best communicate results, whether it's the resulting interaction term or main effects.

## Profile Plots

- If we detect an interaction term, we must give meaning to it.

- An easy way to do this is to plot the treatment group means to visualize the interaction. This is called a profile plot.

    - *y*-axis: always the average outcome
    
    - *x*-axis: either factor A or B
    
        - if only one factor is ordinal, use it for the *x*-axis
        
        - if there are two ordinal or two nominal factors, select the factor with the largest number of levels for the *x*-axis
        
    - lines on the plot: the factor that was not selected for the *x*-axis
    
- Note that this is just a graph of the means -- it's valid to construct a profile plot even if the interaction is not sigificant.

## Example

- Let's first find the treatment means for the birth weight data,

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
means <- data %>%
  group_by(diet, age) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(birthweight)) %>%
  ungroup()
head(means)
```

## Example

- The average birth weight will go on our *y*-axis.

- Because only maternal age is ordinal, it will go on our *x*-axis.

- Thus, the lines will represent the diet

    - This means I want to restructure the dataset with the means to have a column for each of the diets

```{r, echo = TRUE}
A <- means %>% filter(diet == 1) %>% rename(d1 = mean) %>% select(-diet)
B <- means %>% filter(diet == 2) %>% rename(d2 = mean) %>% select(-diet)
C <- means %>% filter(diet == 3) %>% rename(d3 = mean) %>% select(-diet)
graph <- full_join(A, B, by = "age")
graph <- full_join(graph, C, by = "age")
head(graph)
```

## Example

- Building profile plots using `ggplot()` is a process.

    - First, include a `geom_line()` for each level of the factor creating the lines.
    
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
graph %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = d1), color = "pink") + # diet 1
  geom_line(aes(y = d2), color = "purple") + # diet 2
  geom_line(aes(y = d3), color = "blue") + # diet 3
  theme_bw()
```

## Example

<center>
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
graph %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = d1), color = "pink") + # diet 1
  geom_line(aes(y = d2), color = "purple") + # diet 2
  geom_line(aes(y = d3), color = "blue") + # diet 3
  theme_bw()
```
</center>

## Example

- Building profile plots using `ggplot()` is a process.

    - Then, add `geom_text()` to label each line (use the line colors to make sure everything is labeled properly).
 
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
graph %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = d1), color = "pink") + # diet 1
  geom_line(aes(y = d2), color = "purple") + # diet 2
  geom_line(aes(y = d3), color = "blue") + # diet 3 
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 137, label = "Diet 1"), color = "pink")  + # diet 1
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 115, label = "Diet 2"), color = "purple")  + # diet 2
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 110, label = "Diet 3"), color = "blue")  + # diet 3
  theme_bw()
```

## Example

<center>
```{r, eval= TRUE, echo = FALSE}
graph %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = d1), color = "pink") + # diet 1
  geom_line(aes(y = d2), color = "purple") + # diet 2
  geom_line(aes(y = d3), color = "blue") + # diet 3+ 
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 137, label = "Diet 1"), color = "pink")  + # diet 1
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 115, label = "Diet 2"), color = "purple")  + # diet 2
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 110, label = "Diet 3"), color = "blue")  + # diet 3
  theme_bw()
```
</center>

## Example

- Building profile plots using `ggplot()` is a process.

    - Then, clean up time:
    
        - Fix axis titles
        - Change line colors to black*
    
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
graph %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = d1), color = "black") + # diet 1
  geom_line(aes(y = d2), color = "black") + # diet 2
  geom_line(aes(y = d3), color = "black") + # diet 3+ 
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 137, label = "Diet 1"), color = "black")  + # diet 1
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 115, label = "Diet 2"), color = "black")  + # diet 2
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 110, label = "Diet 3"), color = "black")  + # diet 3
  labs(x = "Maternal Age",
       y = "Average Birth Weight") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Example

<center>
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
graph %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = d1), color = "black") + # diet 1
  geom_line(aes(y = d2), color = "black") + # diet 2
  geom_line(aes(y = d3), color = "black") + # diet 3+ 
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 137, label = "Diet 1"), color = "black")  + # diet 1
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 115, label = "Diet 2"), color = "black")  + # diet 2
  geom_text(aes(x = "30" , y = 110, label = "Diet 3"), color = "black")  + # diet 3
  labs(x = "Maternal Age",
       y = "Average Birth Weight") +
  theme_bw()
```
</center>

## Posthoc Tests

- We can also apply posthoc testing to two-way ANOVA.

    - If the interaction is significant, we can compare all treatment groups.
    
    - If the interaction is not significant, we can look at the main effects.
    
- For simplicity, we will only look at Tukey's and Fisher's.

- What is the difference between Tukey's and Fisher's?
    
## Posthoc Tests

- We can also apply posthoc testing to two-way ANOVA.

    - If the interaction is significant, we can compare all treatment groups.
    
    - If the interaction is not significant, we can look at the main effects.
    
- For simplicity, we will only look at Tukey's and Fisher's.

- What is the difference between Tukey's and Fisher's?

    - <font color="#db0b9d">Both perform all pairwise comaprisons.</font>
    
    - <font color="#db0b9d">Tukey's adjusts $\alpha$ while Fisher's does not.</font>
    
## Example

- Let's apply Tukey's to the model with the interaction term.

    - **Important!!** Remember that we are only doing this for illustration purposes - we should not perform posthoc testing on something non-significant.
    
```{r}
m <- aov(birthweight ~ diet + age + diet:age, data = data)
TukeyHSD(m)$"diet:age"
```

## Example

- Let's apply Tukey's to the model without the interaction term.
    
```{r}
m <- aov(birthweight ~ diet + age, data = data)
TukeyHSD(m)$diet
```

- Which diets are significantly different? Use $\alpha=0.05$.

## Example

- Let's apply Tukey's to the model without the interaction term.
    
```{r}
m <- aov(birthweight ~ diet + age, data = data)
TukeyHSD(m)$diet
```

- Which diets are significantly different? Use $\alpha=0.05$.

    - <font color="#db0b9d">Diet 1 and Diet 2 ($p = 0.019$).</font>
    - <font color="#db0b9d">Diet 1 and Diet 3 ($p = 0.004$).</font>
