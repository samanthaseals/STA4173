## Introduction

-   In this lecture, we will review summary statistics

    -   Continuous variables

        -   Mean
        -   Median
        -   Percentiles / quartiles
        -   Variance and standard deviation
        -   Interquartile range

    -   Categorical variables

        -   Count
        -   Percentage

## Summary Statistics: Introduction

-   In this course, we will review formulas, but we will use R for computational purposes

    -   Remember to refer to the lecture notes for specific code needed

    -   Code is also available on this course's [GitHub repository](http://github.com/samanthaseals/STA4173)
    
- We can use base R for some things, but other things we will use the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [`janitor`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/janitor/versions/2.1.0) packages.

- If we need to install packages, we use the `install.packages()` function,
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("package name")
```

- To call packages in, we use the `library()` function,
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

## Summary Statistics: Mean

-   Definition: sample arithmetic mean

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n} $$

-   R syntax:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# method 1: base R
mean(vector) # if your variable is not part of a dataset
mean(dataset$variable) # if your variable is part of a dataset

# method 2: tidyverse
dataset %>% summarize(mean(variable))
```

## Summary Statistics: Mean

-   The following data represent the first exam score of 10 randomly selected students in STA2023. Find the average exam score.

<center>82, 77, 90, 71, 62, 68, 74, 84, 94, 88</center>

```{r}
scores <- c(82, 77, 90, 71, 62, 68, 74, 84, 94, 88)
mean(scores)
```

- Definition: sample variance

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2}{n}}{n-1}$$

- Definition:  sample standard deviation

$$s = \sqrt{s^2}$$

- R syntax:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# method 1: base R
var(vector) or sd(vector) # if your variable is not part of a dataset
var(dataset$variable) or sd(dataset$variable) # if your variable is part of a dataset

# method 2: tidyverse
dataset %>% summarize(var(variable), sd(variable))

## Summary Statistics: Median

- Definition: median

    - The value that lies in the middle of the data when arranged in ascending order.
    
        - If *n* is odd, then the median is literally the middle number.
    
        - If *n* is even, then the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
    
- R syntax:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# method 1: base R
median(vector) # if your variable is not part of a dataset
median(dataset$variable) # if your variable is part of a dataset

# method 2: tidyverse
dataset %>% summarize(median(variable))
```

## Summary Statistics: Frequency Tables

- When we are dealing with categorical data, we summarize using frequency tables.

    - We are interested in the count and percentage

- e.g., from the [UWF Fact Book](https://uwf.edu/academic-affairs/departments/institutional-research/enrollment-fact-book/enrollment-overview/), in Fall 2021, there were

    - 1273 (`r round(127300/(1273+1349+2431+3807),1)`%) freshmen 
    - 1349 (`r round(134900/(1273+1349+2431+3807),1)`%) sophomores
    - 2431 (`r round(243100/(1273+1349+2431+3807),1)`%) juniors
    - 3807 (`r format(round(380700/(1273+1349+2431+3807)),nsmall=1)`%) seniors
    
- R syntax:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# using the janitor package
dataset %>% tabyl(variable)
```

## Summary Statistics: Frequency Tables

- Consider the [Motor Trends car road tests data](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars), built into R.

- The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend magazine, and includes aspects of car design and performance for 32 cars (1973-74 models). 
    
```{r}
data("mtcars")
head(mtcars, n=5)
```
    
## Summary Statistics: Frequency Table

- Let's find the frequency tables for the number of cylinders and the type of transmission (automatic vs. manual),

```{r}
mtcars %>% tabyl(cyl)
mtcars %>% tabyl(am)
```

## Summary Statistics: Frequency Table

- Let's find the frequency tables for the number of cylinders and transmission type together.

- First, with column percentages,

    - e.g., what percentage of automatic transmissions have an engine with 8 cylinders?

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  tabyl(cyl, am) %>%
  adorn_percentages("col") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>%
  adorn_ns()
```


## Summary Statistics: Frequency Table

- Let's find the frequency tables for the number of cylinders and transmission type together.

- Next, with row percentages,

    - e.g., what percentage of engines with 8 cylinders have automatic transmissions?

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  tabyl(cyl, am) %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>%
  adorn_ns()
```



## Data Visualization: Introduction

- When presenting results to others, sometimes it is helpful to create a visualization.

- Continuous data:

    - Histogram (one variable)
    - Scatterplot (two variables)
    
- Categorical data:

    - Bar charts
    
- Related to analyses:

    - Confidence intervals
    - Regression lines
    
- We can also use color to incorporate other variables 

    - e.g., scatterplot with weight on *y*-axis, age on *x*-axis, markers colored by diabetic status

## Data Visualization: Introduction

- We will use the [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package for most of our graphing needs.

    - This package is loaded in with the `tidyverse` package.

- A good reference book is the official [`ggplot2`: elegant graphics for data analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html) text.

    - You can buy a hard copy, however, it is available online for free.

- I will often google keywords + ggplot2 and look for examples that provide code.

    - e.g., "histogram ggplot2" led me to [this website](https://statisticsglobe.com/ggplot2-histogram-in-r-geom_histogram-function)
    
    - e.g., "change color of dot ggplot2" led me to [this website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71431290/how-to-change-the-color-of-points-on-data-plot)

    - Sometimes I have to look at several links before I find what I am looking for.

## Data Visualization: Introduction

- We start with the `ggplot()` function to specify our underlying canvas.

<center>
```{r}
ggplot()
```
</center>

## Data Visualization: Introduction

- We will use the `tidyverse` pipe operator (`%>%`) to pipe data into the `ggplot()` function.

<center>
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dataset %>% ggplot()
```
</center>

- Then, we will specify the aesthetics using `aes()` inside of `ggplot()`.

<center>
```{r}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg))
```
</center>

## Data Visualization: Introduction

- We will add elements to our graph using `geom_` functions.

    - `geom_line()` creates a line
    - `geom_point()` creates a scatterplot
    - `geom_bar()` creates a bar chart
    - `geom_text()` puts text on the graph
    - You can find a list of `geom_` functions [on the `tidyverse` website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/)
    
- The order that you add them matters!

    - `geom_line()` + `geom_point()` = points on top of line
    - `geom_point()` + `geom_line()` = line on top of points

## Data Visualization: Introduction

- We can also customize every aspect of our graphs.

    - e.g., the default background is gray, but I personally do not like it, so I typically use `theme_minimal()` or `theme_bw()` to give a white background
    
    - e.g., we can increase the font size to make things readable
    
    - e.g., we can specify colors for: markers (dots/points),  outline of a bar chart or histogram, filling of a bar chart or histogram, lines, text, etc.
    
- There are additional functions within other (non-`tidyverse`) packages that will help us with customization.
    
    - We can put graphs together using the [`ggarrange()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggpubr/versions/0.5.0/topics/ggarrange) function in the [`ggpubr`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggpubr/versions/0.5.0) package

    - We can use [`geom_emoji()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggimage/versions/0.3.0/topics/geom_emoji) from the the [`emoGG`](https://r-charts.com/miscellaneous/emogg/) to display emojis in graphs :)

## Data Visualization: Introduction

- I do not expect you to become an expert in data visualization

- As with other R code, I will provide basic code during lecture

- I do encourage curiosity and exploring further 

- R is a very, very powerful tool for graphing!

    - Even before I was An Official R Programmer^&copy;^, I used `ggplot2` to construct graphs.
    
    - Other programs are just not great. :(
    
- Today we will look at graphs that go along with summary statistics, but we will learn other ways to graph data as we progress through the semester.

## Wrap Up

- Today we have reviewed how to describe data.

    - Summary statistics
    - Basic data visualization

- There is not a one-size-fits-all graph!

    - Always keep in mind what is the story we are trying to tell and what aids in our explanation.

- In lab, we will learn how to create a table of descriptives.

- Next class, we will review statistical inference.

    - Confidence intervals
    - Hypothsis testing
