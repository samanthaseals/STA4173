College mathematics instructors suggest that students spend 2 hours outside class studying for every hour in class. So, for a 4-credit-hour math class, students should spend at least 8 hours (480 minutes) studying each week. The given data, from Michael Sullivan's College Algebra class, represent the time spent on task recorded in MyLabMath (in minutes) for randomly selected students during the third week of the semester. The data is as follows:
