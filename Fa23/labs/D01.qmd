Let's consider the [Hollywood Age Gaps](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-02-14/readme.md) dataset from [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). This dataset contains information on the age gap between movie love interests with the following rules:

- The two actors play characters with actual romantic interests (i.e., not just friends or coworkers).

- The youngest of the two actors is at least 17 years old.

- Animated characters are excluded.

Pulling in the data,

```{r} 
# do not change anything in this chunk
library(tidyverse)
age_gaps <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-02-14/age_gaps.csv') %>%
  mutate(both_sexes = case_when(character_1_gender == "woman" & character_2_gender == "man" ~ "woman & man",
                                character_1_gender == "man" & character_2_gender == "woman" ~ "woman & man",
                                character_1_gender == "woman" & character_2_gender == "woman" ~ "woman & woman",
                                character_1_gender == "man" & character_2_gender == "man" ~ "man & man"))
```

**1. Find the mean age gap (*age_gap*).**

```{r}

```

**2. Find the standard deviation of age gap (*age_gap*).**

```{r}

```

**3. Find the mean age gap (*age_gap*) for each of sex groupings (*both_sexes*). Hint: ask Dr. Seals about `group_by()` during lab!**

```{r}

```

**4. Find the standard deviation of age gap (*age_gap*) for each of sex groupings (*both_sexes*). Hint: ask Dr. Seals about `group_by()` during lab!**

```{r}

```

**5. Create a scatterplot with age gap (*age_gap*) on the *y*-axis and movie release year (*release_year*) on the *x*-axis. For extra credit, color the markers (dots or points on the graph) by sex grouping (*both_sexes*).**

```{r}

```

**6. What are your hobbies?**

**7. What are your career goals?**

**8. How do you think statistics will help you in the future?**

**9. What is your favorite color? Type your answer in that color. Hint: [Google has a tool.](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker)**

**10. Edit the code below to insert your favorite (...school appropriate...) gif below.**
